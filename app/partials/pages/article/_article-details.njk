                    <p class="text">There’s only one thing that every single culture, religion, and country in the world, agrees on? and it’s that there are only seven days in the week. Not one more or not one less. The reason why we organize our lives around a 7-day week is, quite literally, above our heads. Like many other calendars, today's Gregorian calendar is ultimately based on the phases of the Moon. It takes the Moon around 29.5 days to cycle through all Moon phases. For everyday purposes, this is a fairly long and impractical time span, so it makes sense to break it down into smaller segments.</p>
                    <img src="./image/innerpage/calendar.png" alt="calendar" class="w-100">
                    <p class="text">Enter the Babylonians. This ancient society, which lived in Mesopotamia in what is now Iraq, rounded the Moon cycle down to 28 days and divided this time span into 4 periods of 7 days each, using leap days to stay in sync with the Moon phases in the long run. This 7-day structure is also believed to have ultimately informed a number of popular creation myths, such as the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew and Christian Bibles, which states that God created the world in seven days: six days of work followed by one day of rest.</p>

                    <p class="text">Thousands of years ago there was no iPhone or watches to tell the time. So they would look up at the planet and their positions to guess it! They saw seven planets including the sun and the moon. Believe that each had superpowers. so they started to worship them. One planet will be the God of Justice, one planet will be the god of love. And just like that, every planet becomes a god. They wanted this god to watch over them 24/7. So they assign on god to every hour of the day. and eventually, they even gave a whole day to each. <span>AND THAT’S HOW WE ENDED UP WITH 7 DAYS FOR 7 GODS.</span></p>
